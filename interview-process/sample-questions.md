# Sample Interview Questions

## 1st Nonrepeating character

Write a method to find the first non-repeated character in a string. 
For instance, the first non-repeated character in “total” is ‘o’ and the first non-repeated character in “teeter” is ‘r’. 
P.S: Discuss the efficiency of your algorithm.


## Max Sum Average & Median

Given an unordered array of integers, calculate the max, sum, average and median.
P.S: Discuss the efficiency of your algorithm.


## Remove Duplicates

Write a method that accepts a sorted array of numbers and removes the duplicates, returns an array of the unique numbers, still in order.


## String Rotation

Write a method is_rotation that, given two strings, will determine if one string is a rotation of the other.
e.g.  is_rotation("doghouse", "usedogho") returns true
You can rotate the letters of "usedogho" to create "doghouse"
e.g.  is_rotation("dog", "dgo") returns false
This is not a rotation even though the same letters are used exactly.
Note: This is not a permutation problem.


## Largest Area

Write a method that takes in an array of arrays. Each array has two numbers inside, the length and width of a rectangle. 

Example input: [[1,2],[4,6],[4,3]]. Return the largest area.

## Maximum Subarray

Maximum subarray problem: Find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. 
The array contains both positive and negative numbers.

## Pairs that add up to sum

Given an array of integers write a program that will determine if any two numbers add up to a specified number N
