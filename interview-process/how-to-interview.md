# How To Approach Interviews

## Goals

- List the recommended steps to take in a whiteboard interview

## Introduction

Years of practice performing technical interviews have lead Ada to develop a process for interviewing.  These steps describe a general approach and are useful to:

- Reduce nervousness by providing the candidate with a script to follow and practice
- Reduce the chances of misunderstanding the problem
- Encourage the candidate to engage the interviewer and convey their thought process

In this lesson we will apply these steps to the following interview question:

```
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.
```

## Starting the Interview

A technical interview typically starts like a general interview with introductions and a bit of discussion.

Candidates should be prepared to talk about:

- Prior work experience
- Past projects
- Items highlighted on their resume
- Why they are excited about the position

## This Will Sound Familiar

If this process sounds famialiar... It SHOULD!  The **P**roblem **S**olving **E**xercises (PSEs) you have submitted almost every week, are designed to help you practice the interview process!

## Introduction of the Whiteboard Problem

After the introductions are concluded the interviewer will introduce the whiteboard problem(s).  Candidates should remember to let the interviewer finish providing the problem and take notes.

After the interviewer finishes the question, the candidate should repeat the problem in their own words to verify they understand the problem.

### Ask Clarifying Questions

Before starting on the solution, the candidate should ask clarifying questions.  Clarifying questions can help identify any missing bits of information needed to solve the problem, and identify requirements.

### Determine Test Input-Output

The next step is to determine sample input into the problem and the resulting output.  This allows the applicant to verify how well they understand the problem and identify how the answer is determined.

When creating sample input-output, look for edge-cases.  Solicit feedback from the interviewer to verify that the sample input and output values are correct and that you understand the problem.

Keep note of the sample input and output values because they can be useful in testing the solution.

It can also be quite helpful to ask for **test cases**.  Some interviewers may provide pre-written unit tests for the problem, others may provide useful input-output examples of their own.  Candidates who ask for test cases also demonstrate a knowledge of Test Driven Development.

**Example**:

```
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

Sample #1:
Input:  21
Output: False

Sample #2
Input: 1
Output: True
```

### Describe The Approach

After developing sample input and output values, being developing a solution.  Describe the approach to the interviewer and write down the steps.  Pseudocode can be quite helpful.  Get feedback from the interviewer and listen to any questions they have.  The interviewer will often ask questions to help identify bugs in the approach or unforseen edge-cases.

**Example**

```
We will take in the sample number `num`

loop until num mod 2 is not 0
  - num = num mod 2

loop until num mod 3 is not 0
  - num = num mod 3

loop until num mod 5 is not 0
  - num = num mod 5

if num is 1 return True
Otherwise return False
```

### !callout-success

## Pro-Tip Use "We"

When discussing the problem a candidate should try to engage the interviewer in the process as a collaborator.  Use terms like "we" when talking about the problem and the solution.  

In general, an interviewer *wants* the candidate to succeed. By engaging in a collaborative process, you can both become more at-ease and solicit more helpful feedback.

### !end-callout

### Begin Coding

Once the candidate has discussed the approach with the interviewer and answered any questions, it is time to begin coding.

While coding the solution, it is important to remember to:

- Explain each step as you code
- When pausing to think, speak out loud about your thought process. Interviewers need to understand what the candidate is thinking.
- Pause regularly to test each step using the input-output values from before

Remember **communication is key**.  An interviewer needs to understand the candidate's thinking.

### !callout-success

## Pro Tip - Ask for Help

When stuck, there is nothing wrong with a candidate asking for help.  The interviewer could respond with, "no," but often will respond with a useful tip to get the candidate past the sticking point.

### Test Your Solution

When a candidate finishes programming, they should test their solution with the sample input and output values and verify that the solution works.  Testing helps verify that no edge-cases have been missed.

### Solution Discussion

After presenting the solution, the candidate will often be expected to discuss the pros and cons of the solution as it is written.  Candidates should be prepared to identify the time and space complexity and talk about alternate approaches (if time allows).  

Interviews can be stressful and time constrained, so a candidate may not have had time to refactor and create an ideal solution, but they can discuss what next steps they would follow.

### !callout-success

## Perfection is **NOT** the Goal

The goal of a good interviewer is to understand what the candidate could bring to the team. It is **not** to see if the candidate arrives at a perfect solution, whether or not one might exist. 

Interviewers want to know:

- Will this candidate respond to feedback?
- Can this candidate communicate their thoughts in a technical environment?
- Would this candidate be a good team member?
- How well does this candidate solve problems?
- Is this a person who could mesh with our team?

### !end-callout

### Interview Conclusion

At the conclusion of the interview the candidate should thank the interviewer for their time.  The company will normally follow up later to either move forward or not.


## Steps in an Interview

1.  Listen to the question
1.  Example walk through (leverage the white board or screen)
1.  Describe solution (brute force is ok)
1.  Write solution
1.  Optimize and test
1.  Discuss the solution 

## Interview Dos and Don'ts

| Dos  	|  Don'ts 	|
|---	|---	|
|   Do make sure you understand the problem statement (perhaps with an example).	|  Don’t make assumptions. 	|
|  Do clarify the requirements.|   Don’t ignore the information given.	|
|  Do design before you code.  |  Don’t jump straight to coding. (Get the interviewer to sign off on your design and give you the green light to code.)  |
|  Do share possible alternative solutions and their time, space complexities. Discuss which approach to code.  |  Don’t silently work through the problem. (They are looking to understand your thought process. Give them a chance to understand.)  |
|  Do share your thought process for algorithms.  | Don’t call your work done before ensuring it works for at least some basic functional test cases (and more).  |
|  Do use examples to share your approach.  |   |
|  Do stop, think and share. (Especially if are confused or unsure if something would work.)   |   |
|  Do test your own code. |    |
