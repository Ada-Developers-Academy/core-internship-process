- Here is a [list of questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-fFpHzi2YiRsgniwDcNGTAnDSc44f_OFLfdg5fRfsQw/edit?usp=sharing) to get to know a company during Company Presentations. 


## Resumes & Bios

You should create both your resume and bio as a markdown file that is a gist. See a how-to on [gists here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists). Make sure to add .md to the file name in your gist so it will be formatted correctly! These are due **by June 4**.

### Resumes

**Here are some examples:**
