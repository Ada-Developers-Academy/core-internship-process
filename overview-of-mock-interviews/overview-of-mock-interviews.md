## When
Mock interviews will take place between November 15th and December 17th, lasting one hour. To make your interview prep as self-directed as possible, we’ll connect you to a volunteer, and you will both coordinate a time to meet.  


## What
Students have the opportunity to mock interview with an Ada volunteer once  during the classroom phase and again during the internship phase. Using a video chat platform of your choice and a Repl.it document, you will work through a whiteboard problem using Python, and then talk through solutions, practice areas, and general interview skills. At the end, you will complete a check-out form to confirm you completed your mock interview, and to reflect on your learnings and next steps for continued practice.  


## Interview Structure
- 5 mins - get to know you
- 30 mins - technical/whiteboarding problem 
- 25 mins - feedback on process and solution, work together on the problem, general interview skills  


## Where
All interviews will be remote. You or your interviewer will set up a video conference link to use alongside your Repl.it doc.  


## Why
The goal of mock interviews is to give you a low-stakes space to experience whiteboarding with a stranger. This is an opportunity to identify your practice areas and build confidence. 


## Understanding Repl.it
Repl.it is the same tool you used for Ada admissions so you should already have an account, but please make sure you can access it and re-familiarize yourself with the platform prior to your interview.  

By creating your own Repl document, you’ll be able to save your work and refer to it later. To create your own Repl document simply click “Create Repl” in the top left of the main page, and then select Python as your language. When you get to internship, you’ll be able to select the language of your choice for your second mock interview.
